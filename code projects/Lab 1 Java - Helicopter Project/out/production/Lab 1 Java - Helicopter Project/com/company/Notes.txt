    Helicopter -
        Properties:
            maxFuel - how much fuel the copter CAN have
                     - DATA TYPE: Double
            currentFuel - how much fuel the copter DOES have
                         - DATA TYPE: Double
            Location - what city the copter is in
        Constructor:
            sets the max fuel and fills the gas to the max fuel limit. also sets location to Cleveland(city[0])
        Methods:
            flyToLocation(Location ...) - checks to see if you have enough fuel and if u have it then you fly away. if you can't
            refuel() - fills fuel up to the maxFuel amount if you are in a location with a gas station.
            getFuel() - returns how much fuel you have


    Location -
        Would be useful to set up an array of locations instead of individual objects
        Properties:
            name - city name
            coordinates - x and y
            hasFuel - boolean
        Constructor:
            take x and y parameters and a city name parameter
        Methods:
            getters - x, y, hasFuel, and name
            getDistance - returns the distance between two locations
                        - this would be passed another object of the Location Class
                            - i.e. getDistance(Location Tokyo){...}
